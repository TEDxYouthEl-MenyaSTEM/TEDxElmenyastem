The theme for the event is the (space and Black Hole). Space is full of things that no one knows, and modern science is still trying to uncover these mysteries. These mysteries are still increasing until this time, but they are by defeat, insistence, research, and exploration despite all their many discoveries. What you want, you can do but you must be patient and persistent, and we want to let the audience know now about space and the many discoveries of scientists and how they faced difficulties and achieved many of their goals.">

                                Omar Gabaly seemed during high school to think of a new sport called Street Workout and
                                decided to train this sport at home beside his studies.

                                psychologically destroy people from all the pressures of subjects they study from
                                subjects that need intensive research and study. Many people are lost at that point in
                                life and don't know where to go or what to do in order to achieve what they want.

                                What do you expect when going to one of many TEDx Events?
                                Of course, one expects various activities and various speakers on various topics
                                surrounding one concept.

                                Also breaks between talks and sessions are filled with joyous activities and such people
                                like Steven Abadir!

                                event, improves the atmosphere of the event instead of it being all around our
                                scientific topic and can reach the point of boredom occasionally ✨
